# stock-chart

This is one of my very first clojure apps that plotted how a stock price moved before and after a companies release date. Originally it used the incanter library to plot a line graph of the stock movement. Later it was changed to use clojurescript and rickshaw.js to plot the line graphs within a web-page.
Stock price data was pulled from Yahoo Finance, and earnings release dates were scraped from html pages located at briefing.com.

## Usage

The app used a very early version of clojurescript and has not been maintained. Additionally the Yahoo APIs that were used to retrieve stock price data have been taken down, as well as the briefing.com pages used to scrape earnings release date data. Basically, this app will no longer run as it stands today.
